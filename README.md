**HuffmanZip (Hz)** is a simple macOS application built with Swift 6.1 that demonstrates how to compress and decompress files using the [Huffman Coding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is provided for educational purposes only. It is not optimized for performance or real-world use. Use at your own risk.


## ✨ Features

- [x] 📦 Compress any file using the Huffman algorithm
- [x] 📂 Decompress previously compressed `.hz` files
- [ ] 🔍 View compression statistics and tree structure (optional in debug mode)


## 🧠 Why Huffman?

Huffman coding is a classic lossless data compression algorithm. While no longer optimal compared to modern codecs, it’s widely used as an educational introduction to entropy encoding.
